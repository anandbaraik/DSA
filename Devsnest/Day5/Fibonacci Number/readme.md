> The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

```
    F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
    F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
```

Given n, calculate F(n).

**Try doing it in both recursive and iterative method**

# Input Format

First Parameter - Integer n

# Output Format

Return the integer

## Example 1:

```
Input:
    3
Output:
    2
Explanation:
    F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input:
    4
Output:
    3
Explanation:
    F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
```

### Constraints:

- 0 <= n <= 30
