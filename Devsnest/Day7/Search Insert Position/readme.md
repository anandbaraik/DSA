> Given an sorted array `arr` of size `n` and an integer `key`. If the target exists in the array, return its index. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

# Input Format

First Parameter - number `n`

Second Parameter - array `arr` of size `n`

Third Parameter - number `key`

# Output Format

Return the number.

## Example 1:

```
Input:
    5
    1 3 4 5 10
    2
Output:
    1
Explanation:
    Since 2 is missing from the given array, it would be inserted at index 1.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input:
    5
    1 3 8 9 11
    9
Output:
    3
Explanation:
    The key 9 was found at index 3.
```

### Constraints

- 1 < n <= 104
- -104 <= arr[i], key <= 104
- All the integers in `arr` are unique.
- `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
- Expected Time Complexity: O(log n)
- Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
