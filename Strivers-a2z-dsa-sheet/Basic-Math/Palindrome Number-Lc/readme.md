Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

# Example

```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

### Constraints:

`-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
