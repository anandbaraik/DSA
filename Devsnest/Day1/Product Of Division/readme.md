> You are given two integers, a and b.
> Let x be the integer division and y be the decimal(float) division of a and b.
> Return the product of x and y.

# Input Format

First Parameter - Integer a

Second Parameter - Integer b

# Output Format

Return the decimal product of integer division x and decimal division y of a and b.

### Example 1:

```
    Input:
        21
        5
    Output:
        16.8
    Explanation:
        The int and float value of 21 / 5 is 4 and 4.2 respectively. The product is 16.8
```

### Example 2:

```
    Input:
        11
        4
    Output:
        5.5
    Explanation:
        The integer and float value of (11 / 4) is 2 and 2.75 respectively. The product is 5.5
```

#### Constraints

- Range of a and b is [-104, 104] except 0.
- Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
- Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
