> You are given two integers, a and b. Compute the Sum and Difference of a and b. Return the Product of Sum and Difference.

# Input Format

First Parameter - Integer a

Second Parameter - Integer b

## Output Format

Return the integer.

### Example 1:

```
Input:
    5
    2
Output:
    21
Explanation:
    Sum is (5 + 2)  = 7 and Difference is (5 - 2) = 3. The product of Sum and Difference is 21.
```

### Example 2:

```
    Input:
        -14
        -4
    Output:
        180
```

### Explanation:

> The Sum is -18 and Difference is -10. The product is 180.

#### Constraints

- -104 <= a, b <= 104
- Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
- Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
