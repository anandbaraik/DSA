> You are given an array of prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on an ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

# Input Format

First Parameter - number `n`

Second Parameter - array of integers of size `n`

# Output Format

Return the number.

## Example 1:

```
Input:
    6
    7 1 5 3 6 4
Output:
    5
Explanation:
    Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
    Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input:
    5
    7 6 4 3 1
Output:
    0
Explanation:
    In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

### Constraints:

- 1 <= prices.length <= 105
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 104
- Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
- Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
